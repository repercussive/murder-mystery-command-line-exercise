Hidden in the darkness of the cupboard is a yellowed recipe book. 

The recipes are all very strange, with names like "Four-dimensional alloy" and "Fractal resin". All the ingredients appear to be written in some kind of code.

Flipping through the pages of the book, a loose page falls out. It reads:

===============================================================

The three segments of the key lie scattered throughout this home, each one in a separate room:

- The prime number bound to my birth.
- The record's whisper, a sound reversed in air.
- The knowledge of the divine series, stored on shelves. Count these sacred volumes.

You must also combine the three segments in the correct order.

The hallway is this house's spine. Travel from its end to the entrance, and you will pass the doors to each room in a sequence.

Combine the three segments corresponding to this sequence. If you are worthy, you will be granted access to the secrets I have hidden.
