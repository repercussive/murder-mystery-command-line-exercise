There's a vinyl record player here. An unusual record rests under the needle - it's unlabelled and a little warped.

To play the record, enter the following command in the terminal while in the living room:

code .record.mp3

(Both "." characters are necessary!)

Then press the play button to start the audio preview. You can also download the audio if you wish...

Bizarrely, the record seems to spin anticlockwise rather than clockwise when played.
