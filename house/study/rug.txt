The rug on the floor is unique, bearing the image of a spiral. 

There's something familiar about the shape. It looks like the "golden spiral", derived from the Fibonacci sequence. It's said to appear in nature, such as in the arrangement of the seeds of a sunflower, or in the shape of nautilus shells.

Perhaps this is related in some way to the professor's preoccupation with "divine" numbers...
